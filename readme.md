# Guardian Code Test

This component has been built using webpack, so after cloning it run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.

It uses javascript to make ajax calls to the Guardian's API, however it contains a `<nonscript>` element for static content.

Sections of the the Guardian's base css has been used as well as some of my own.

It has been test on IE10+, Chrome, Safari, Firefox and modern IOS devices. Issue accessing data via XDomainRequest() on IE9.
